<h3>Admin Dashboard - React and Redux App</h3>

This build separates the frontend and backend into their own code builds. By itself this Admin Dashboard will not be able to run without first running and connecting it to an instance of https://github.com/hanleyj1/node_CRUD_server.
Out of the box, Admin_Dashboard is able to make requests to the backend to create and modify user accounts, and products. Following the same template the dashboard can be expanded to handle other admin needs and configurations.
